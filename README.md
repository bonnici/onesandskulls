Ones and Skulls
===============

A website that allows people to upload a Blood Bowl 2 replay and see stats about the dice rolls
that happened in the game. This was written mostly as an experiment in what I could do with
no server and pure JS so that is why the code is like it is. The site is live at 
[onesandskulls.com](http://onesandskulls.com/).
